/*
State design pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern.
State design pattern is used when an Object change its behavior based on its internal state.

The benefits of using State pattern to implement polymorphic behavior is clearly visible.
The chances of error are less and itâ€™s very easy to add more states for additional behavior.
Thus making our code more robust, easily maintainable and flexible. Also State pattern helped
in avoiding if-else or switch-case conditional logic in this scenario.
