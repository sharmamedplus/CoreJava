Strategy design pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern.
Strategy pattern is used when we have multiple algorithm for a specific task and client
decides the actual implementation to be used at runtime.

The Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern.
It allows you to dynamically change the behavior of an object by encapsulating it into different strategies.
This pattern enables an object to choose from multiple algorithms and behaviors at runtime,
rather than statically choosing a single one.
