   /*
    CyclicBarriers are used in programs in which we have a fixed number of threads that must wait
    for each other to reach a common point before continuing execution.

    The constructor for a CyclicBarrier is simple. It takes a single integer that denotes the number
    of threads that need to call the await() method on the barrier instance to signify reaching the
    common execution point.

    Thereâ€™s an operation that a fixed number of threads perform and store the corresponding results in a list.
    When all threads finish performing their action, one of them (typically the last one that trips the barrier)
    starts processing the data that was fetched by each of these.
