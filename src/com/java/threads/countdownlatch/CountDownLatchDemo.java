    using a CountDownLatch we can cause a thread to block until other threads have completed a given task.

    Simply put, a CountDownLatch has a counter field, which you can decrement as we require. We can then
     use it to block a calling thread until itâ€™s been counted down to zero.

    If we were doing some parallel processing, we could instantiate the CountDownLatch with the same value for the
    counter as a number of threads we want to work across. Then, we could just call countdown() after each thread finishes,
    guaranteeing that a dependent thread calling await() will block until the worker threads are finished.
