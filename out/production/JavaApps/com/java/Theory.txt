Many times, we need to perform operations where a stream reduces to single resultant value, for example, maximum, minimum, sum, product, etc. Reducing is the repeated process of combining all elements.

reduce operation applies a binary operator to each element in the stream where the first argument to the operator is the return value of the previous application and second argument is the current stream element.
